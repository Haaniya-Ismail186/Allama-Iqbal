    <h1>HTML Assignment #2</h1>

    
    <!-- Part 1 -->
    <h2>Part 1: The Introduction</h2>
    <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the national poet of Pakistan, was a philosopher and visionary who awakened the spirit of selfhood among Muslims of the subcontinent. His poetry inspires people to rise with courage, faith, and self-respect. Through his verses, he urged humanity to recognize its divine potential and strive for continuous growth and independence.</p>

    <!-- Part 2 -->
    <h2>Part 2: The Spotlight Quote</h2>
    <blockquote>
        “Tu shaheen hai, parwaz hai kaam tera,<br>
        Tere samne aasman aur bhi hain.”
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Part 3 -->
    <h2>Part 3: The Analysis</h2>
    <p>In this verse, Iqbal calls the youth a <b>shaheen</b> (eagle) — a symbol of freedom, strength, and vision. He motivates them to keep soaring higher and never limit their ambitions. <em>The eagle never fears heights; it finds its destiny in the open sky</em>. This powerful metaphor encourages individuals to embrace challenges and rise beyond boundaries with determination and self-belief.</p>

    <!-- Part 4 -->
    <h2>Part 4: More Wisdom</h2>
    <p>Iqbal once said, “Apni duniya aap paida kar agar zinda hai tu,” reminding us that true life lies in creating our own destiny. In another verse, he wrote, “Sitaron se aage jahan aur bhi hain,” showing his belief that the human journey never ends — there are always new worlds to explore and conquer.</p>

    <!-- Part 5 -->
    <h2>Part 5: A Clear Transition</h2>
    
    <p>Allama Iqbal’s poetry continues to light the path of self-awareness and spiritual awakening. His words remain timeless, guiding nations and individuals toward hope, courage, and faith in their own strength.</p>

    <!-- Part 6 -->
    <h2>Part 6: The Final Touch</h2>
    <blockquote>
        “Na tu zameen ke liye hai, na aasman ke liye,<br>
        Jahan hai tere liye, tu nahi jahan ke liye.”
    </blockquote>
